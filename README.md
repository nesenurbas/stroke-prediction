# stroke-prediction

It is not known exactly why people who have had a stroke have a stroke, but researches are continuing to determine which factors affect the probability of having a stroke. In this research, the risk probabilities of the people participating in the research were found and classified depending on variables such as gender, age, hypertension , heart diseases, ever married, working type,  residence type , average glycose levels, body mass index, smoking status. In order to understand why people in the risk group are in the risk group, the data were reanalyzed and numerical values were revealed. After entering the strokecode.ipynb file from the github link sent, all the codes are mixed in and when the download raw file button is pressed in the upper right corner, the codes are downloaded to your computer in a run and viewable format. There is no need to do anything extra to run the project because the codes are already presented in a run form. But if you download the csv files specified as additional files if they are installed on your computer without running, the codes will be ready to work. While developing the project, the python coding language was used and the libraries that python provides ready-made. Project developers:
